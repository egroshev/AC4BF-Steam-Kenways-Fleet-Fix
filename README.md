# AC4BF-Steam-Kenways-Fleet-Fix
The Kenway's Fleet loading screen bug in Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is a PC issue where the minigame's loading screen freezes indefinitely. It's caused by a broken connection to old Ubisoft servers. This can be fixed by replacing the game's executable with an older version that doesn't have the bug, or by using offline mode.
